# SmartLearn

##Description
This program is to help people learn new terms and definitions in an efficient way. There are many services out there, but a popular theme nowadays is to add a subscription based portion to the service for additional functionality. This program aims to provide that additional functionality from these services as a free service instead.

###Installation
Run the .exe in the folder to start the program.
